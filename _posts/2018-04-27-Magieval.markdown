description: "Magieval is a 2D real-time single player vs AI battle royale game \ 
			  where the player needs to explore the world, gather resource and weapon yourself, and then survive to the end. \
			  There is a safe zone shrinking to force the players to a smaller region for combat. \
			  All other competitors are AI and they also have similar behaviors like the player.</br>\
			  </br>\
			  Magieval is a game developed by a team of 3 programmers in 4 months.</br>\
			  It was built by custom component based 2D engine in C++/DirectX from scratch."
