description: "I use A* for pathfinding in a grid-based map. I also use straight line to optimize. \
			  Rubberbanding to decrease the number of the redundant nodes. \
			  Catmull-Rom spline to make the path more smooth.</br></br>\
			  I also did some terrain analysis in this project. </br>\
			  Closest wall: showing the correct ratio color based on the distance to the closest wall. </br>\
			  Visibility: showing the correct ratio color based on the visibility to all the other nodes. </br>\
			  Visible to player: showing the correct ratio color based on the view from the player position. </br>\
			  Search: showing the correct ratio color based on the time of the player's view. </br></br>
			  And I did occupancy map for the project. </br>\
			  Propagation: spread out the color. </br>\
			  And I implemented the hide and seek based on the occupancy map."
