description: "I did Hierarchy task network planning for my AI final project. </br>
			  I built the environment as a RTS game, and the player need to gather the resource or build the factory. \
			  Any action can be seperated into several steps based on the current resource and knowledge. \
			  If the world has changed caused by other situations, the character will reschedule his plan to meet the goal."
